This is my personal Gentoo ebuild overlay used for various projects.

Use this at your own risk!!

At the time of writing you'll find the most current ebuilds for Piwik and B2evolution here.

Also you'll find a few historical ebuilds used for GNAP http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/embedded/gnap.xml until around 2009.
